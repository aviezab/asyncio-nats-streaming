# Asyncio Nats Streaming

### Disclaimer! This project is currently in beta!
I am using this in production at my work but I can deal with my own bugs. You may not feel the same. :) 

### Description
A client implementation of NATS Streaming Protocol utilizing asyncio for fast asynchronous pub/sub.

### Install
Install the client with `pip install asyncio-nats-streaming-client`

#### TODO:

- [] Write some tests -- Could use some help from the community.
- [] Better error handling from NATS protocol
- [] Custom timeouts for pub/sub -- easy level
